Prerequisites:

Be sure that you have all the required Perl modules and an up-to-date
Perl on your system. It was tested with Perl 5.6.1 and 5.8.0 as the time
of this writing.

None core modules used. You probably need to install these: Digest::MD5.
(http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Digest::MD5)
Modules used that are already bundled with Perl 5.6+: Sys::Syslog.
(http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Sys::Syslog)

Let's go:

Run "make install" in the distribution directory. This will install the
Snowbox executable in /usr/local/sbin and create an initial config
directory /etc/snowbox. This directory will contain two files: "config",
the global configuration file for snownews, and "user.auth" which contains
the users allowed to connect to the server. These files will never be
overwritten if they already exist.

The configuration is pretty much self explanatory. See the manpage for
more details about what can be done.
